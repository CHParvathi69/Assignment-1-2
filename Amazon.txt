In emerald hush, where wild vines weave,
The jungle breathes beneath each leaf.
A symphony born from parrot cries,
With sapphire frogs and twilight skies.

The rivers curl like whispered spells,
Through roots and dreams where magic dwells.
A sunbeam dances on the jaguar's fur,
While orchids bloom where breezes purr.

The Amazon sings secrets of old
A tale of life in green and gold.
